# Running an SMP

If you'd like to get your SMP started as fast as possible with BerryByte then heres a great guide to help you get started! 
**Disclaimer**: This guide is for Paper/Spigot only.

## Step 1: Starting your server
Before starting your server, I suggest choosing a server software that fits your needs, In most cases, most people use [Paper](http://papermc.io/]) which is a more optimized version of spigot. Starting your server will generate all the necessary files for you to complete this guide. 

## Step #2: Pre-generating your world
Pre-generating your world saves your server(s) a lot of resources when players are loading chunks. 
This process can be done with a handy plugin called Chunky, we've already made a guide on how to use Chunky and what it does, so we wont be describing it here, but if you'd like the full guide check it out, [here](https://docs.berrybyte.net/games/minecraft/plugins/chunky]). 
 
## Step #3: Installing a few plugins
Installing plugins enhances the Vanilla experience! These plugins don't need to be installed but they are good recommendations. Firstly, navigate to your plugins folder through the Lime panel under File Manager and if you want to add any of these plugins to your minecraft server, just drag the `.jar` file into the Plugins folder. 
### [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/)
EssentialsX adds over 130+ commands to normal minecraft making it easier not just for mods but also for players to play on the server. This plugin adds commands such as `/sethome` `/warps` `tpa` and way more! 
EssentialsX has a lot of addons to the plugin, such as EssentialsX Discord, EssentialsX Chat & a lot more. You can find all of these, [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html]). 
### [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard)
WorldGuard adds protection to your server from griefers, with a few commands you can easily roll back any griefed area/chunk to normal. This is useful for servers that have buildings that need to be protected, with this plugin you can also set player damage to `true` or `false` which is a great feature to it!
### [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/download)
LuckPerms allows you to setup Ranks & Permissions on your Minecraft Server, this can also be done through a web interface which also makes it very easy to use and setup!
### [SmoothTimber](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/smoothtimber.39965/)
SmoothTimber makes it very easy for player to chop down trees whenever they break 1 block of a tree with an axe. This plugin saves a lot of time for players and is overall a great plugin to have on your server!
